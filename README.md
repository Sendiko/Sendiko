##  Hi, I'm Sendiko

I'm a passionate Android developer currently honing my skills at Telkom University Bandung. I'm excited to build modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

**My technical strengths include:**

* **Kotlin:** I leverage the power of Kotlin to write concise, clean, and maintainable code. I'm proficient in utilizing flows, data classes, and interfaces to structure complex data and logic.
* **Jetpack Compose:** I create beautiful and responsive user interfaces using Jetpack Compose. I'm comfortable customizing UI components to achieve your desired design vision.
* **Architectures:** I believe in well-structured applications. I implement MVI (Model-View-Intent) and Clean Architecture principles to promote modularity, testability, and scalability.
* **Data Persistence:** I understand the importance of efficient data storage. I employ Room Database to handle complex and persistent data, while utilizing Datastore Preferences for simpler app state management.
* **Networking:** I'm adept at making HTTP requests using Retrofit. I integrate HttpLoggingInterceptor for insightful debugging and monitoring API interactions.
* **Dependency Injection:** I believe in efficient development practices. I use DaggerHilt as a dependency injection framework to streamline the injection process and improve application code organization.

**I'm always eager to learn new things and contribute to open-source projects.**

**Feel free to reach out to me!**
